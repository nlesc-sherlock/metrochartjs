**Usage (Linux Ubuntu)**

```sh
# use package manager to install git
sudo apt-get install git

# make a local copy of this repository
git clone https://github.com/nlesc-sherlock/chicago.git

# change into chigaco directory
cd chicago

# install nvm somehow, e.g. following these instructions: 
# (http://www.liquidweb.com/kb/how-to-install-nvm-node-version-manager-for-node-js-on-ubuntu-14-04-lts/

# install and start using the latest stable version of node.js
nvm install stable

# the npm install is local to the terminal it was installed in

# verify what version of node you are running:
nvm current

# check available version of npm with 
nvm ls

# you can also check the version of nvm itself, using 
nvm --version

# let the recently loaded node package manager install the project's dependencies as 
# specified in package.json:
npm install

# need bower as well
npm install bower

# during the previous step, the build automation tool 'gulp' was installed locally.
# We also need to install it globally however, using
npm install --global gulp

# we'll also need a global install of typescript
npm install --global typescript

# run npm install, bower install, tsd install through one command
npm run deploy-dev

# build and serve the build directory with
gulp dev-watch

# after running a gulp dev-watch, open up a browser and navigate 
# to http://localhost:3000/ to inspect the website. You've been served!
